# bids-examples

This repository contains a collection of [BIDS-compatible](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
datasets with **empty raw data files**. These datasets have been contributed as
test data for lightweight software tests and to provide examples of how BIDS datasets
may be structured. The [bids-starter-kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit)
is also a good place to look for models of best practice for structuring your BIDS
dataset.   

All of the raw data files in these example datasets are empty.
Some of the datasets have intact metadata headers (including 
`synthetic` and most EEG or iEEG datasets in BrainVision format).
Other datasets have some empty metadata headers.

# Using the example datasets

If you want to use the example datasets with the bids-validator,
you must indicate that empty raw files and certain empty headers should 
be ignored during validation. 

**Example:** For example, suppose you are running the bids-validator
 from the command line and want to validate the example dataset
 `eeg_matchingpennies`. From the parent directory of `eeg_matchingpennies`
 execute the following command:
 
````
 bids-validator eeg_matchingpennies --config.ignore=99 --config.ignore=40
````

See the [bids-validator home page](https://github.com/bids-validator) for
instructions on how to install and/or use the bids-validator.

# Validator configuration for the example datasets

You can put required validator configuration information in a custom 
`.bids-validator-config.json` file in the root of your dataset.
The configuration file that would be required to ignore 
empty raw files and empty Nifti headers is:

````json
{
     "ignore": [99, 40] 
} 
````
 
Some datasets in [bids-examples](https://github.com/bids-examples) may 
have a custom configuration file tailored to ignore errors generated 
from idiosyncracies particular to that dataset. 

| name | errors ignored |
| --- | --- |
| genetics_ukbb | SliceTiming values for tasks is larger than given TR, EchoTime1 and EchoTime2 are not provided for any of the phasediff files. |


Other datasets may include a `.SKIP_VALIDATION` file, to skip the validation with the continuous integration service.
This is useful for datasets that *cannot* pass at the moment due to lack of coverage in the [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator).
