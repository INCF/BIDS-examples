Overview
--------

This is the “COFITAGE” dataset. The aim is to collect sleep EEG data from 100 to 120 healthy older 
participants (aged 50-70), in order to quantify sleep disruption, evaluate its impact on cognition
and assess its relationship with brain amyloid and tau proteins deposition in preclinical AD.

We would like to determine which sleep-wake regulation parameters are associated with biomarkers 
and cognitive status at baseline and at a 24 months follow-up of cognitive performances.


Citing this dataset
-------------------

This dataset and related analyses are unpublished. Please do not use/cite given data other than
BIDS dataset example.


Format
------

It is formatted according to BIDS version 1.2.0. The full description of the standard which can be 
found here: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

This dataset is originally created in Embla 3.4 format. It is converted to EDF+ and applied to BIDS 
standard by a private tool. The configuration and log files are stored in the sourcedata folders.


Details about the experiment
----------------------------

In the COFITAGE project, EEG data was collected from volunteers aged 50-70.

The COFITAGE select healthy volunteers of age 50-70 years without any major deviation
that could influence experiment. 

Each subject is submitted to three tasks: 'Habituation Night' (HN), 'Base Line' (BL) and 'ECG'.

Only some samples of 'Habituation Night' are presented in this dataset example, together with few 
'Baseline' samples.


Notes
-----

The events associated with data are stored in separate EDF+ file *_events.edf. This is not conform 
to BIDS, but accepted by EDF. An entry in .bidsignore was added to hide corresponding error
