This dataset contains ECoG as well as fMRI recordings from a single patient obtained while the patient performed three different visual tasks. The ECoG data was recorded at NYU School of Medicine (SOM). The fMRI data was recorded post-operatively at NYU Department of Psychology (NYU). A separate pre-operative T1weighted MRI scan was collected at SOM.  These data were collected as part of an NIH Brain Initiative supported project. 

The dataset is as of yet unpublished. The data was collected by	Jonathan Winawer (NYU) and Stephanie Montenegro (NYU). The BIDS formatting was performed by Iris Groen (NYU) with help from Giovanni Piantoni (UMC Utrecht) and Dora Hermes (UMC Utrecht). The project is funded by the National Institute Of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01MH111417 to Natalia Petridou (UMC Utrecht) and Jonathan Winawer. The ECoG data collection was facilitated by Orrin Devinsky (NYU SOM) and Adeen Flinker (NYU SOM).
