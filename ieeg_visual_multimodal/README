Overview
--------
This dataset contains ECoG as well as fMRI recordings from a single patient obtained 
while the patient performed three different visual tasks (spatialobject, spatialpattern, 
and temporalpattern). The ECoG data was recorded at NYU School of Medicine (SOM). 
The fMRI data was recorded post-operatively at NYU Department of Psychology (NYU). 
A separate pre-operative T1weighted MRI scan was collected at SOM.  

These data were collected as part of an NIH Brain Initiative supported project. The 
overarching goal of this project is to build empirically supported models of visual 
and somatosensory population responses by linking together neural signals (measured 
with ECoG) and BOLD responses (measured with fMRI). This is a visual experimental 
dataset; the same tasks were run in both modalities to allow for comparison of the 
ECoG and BOLD responses. For details about the tasks, see the `Details about the 
visual tasks` section.


Citing this dataset
-------------------
The dataset is as of yet (02-26-2019) unpublished. The data was collected by 
Jonathan Winawer (NYU) and Stephanie Montenegro (NYU). The BIDS formatting 
was performed by Iris Groen (NYU) with help from Giovanni Piantoni (UMC Utrecht) 
and Dora Hermes (UMC Utrecht). The project is funded by the National Institute Of 
Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01MH111417 
to Natalia Petridou (UMC Utrecht) and Jonathan Winawer. The ECoG data collection 
was facilitated by Orrin Devinsky (NYU SOM) and Adeen Flinker (NYU SOM).

Format
------
It is formatted according to BIDS version 1.1.5 and the BIDS standard extension
for iEEG (BEP010), which can be found here:

Note that BEP010 was not yet integrated in the main BIDS-spec by 02-26-2019.

Details about the visual tasks
----------------------------
All tasks involved brief presentations of a single visual stimulus presented at 8 
degrees of visual angle. All stimuli were band-pass filtered to have single 
spatial frequency of 3 cycles per degree. During the 'spatialobject' task, images
Of houses, faces and letters were shown. During the 'spatial pattern' task, images 
of randomly generated curved line segments were shown that were systematically varied 
in the level of contrast and density, as well as three types of gratings. During 
the 'temporal pattern', the same pattern stimuli were shown at fixed (high) contrast, 
either for one presentation per trial (one-pulse) or two presentations (two-pulse). 
For the one-pulse stimuli, stimulus duration was varied; for the two-pulse stimuli, 
inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) was varied. Please see events.json files for details.
